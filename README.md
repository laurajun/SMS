Spring Boot Student Management System

This is a base for a SMS which I learned to create with Java Guides coding course. You can check it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYGnVeCs0Yg 

I used Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web developers, Version: 2021-06 (4.20.0) with Spring Tools 4: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tools-4-aka-spring-tool-suite-4
I also had these installed earlier: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-enterprise-java-and-web-developer-tools

Spring boot starter project took care of necessary Maven dependencies.

I used JDK 16.0.1.

I run mysql on Apache via XAMPP, so I made new database there for this project.
